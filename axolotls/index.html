  <h1>All About Axolotls</h1>
  <hr>
    <br>
    <h3>What is an axolotl?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Axolotls are a type of amphibian in the salamander family.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm">
          <p>They are closely related to tiger salamanders, but do not follow the same life cycle. Instead of developing into a terrestrial adult, axolotls reach adulthood as aquatic animals.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This is called neoteny. As a result, axolotls hardly ever shed their gills or develop lungs. When they do, it is thought to be caused by a diet rich in iodine.</p>
          </div>
        <div class="col-sm">
          <img src="img/axolotl.jpg" width="100%"/>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm">
          <p>Most salamanders start as eggs, which hatch into larva. Larva have gill buds, which will develop into full gills, and they'll also grow limbs - usually front first then back.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The transition to adulthood in most salamanders is then developing lungs, losing gills, and moving onto land. Axolotls stay at the developed larval stage and reach full sexual maturity there.</p>

        <h3>Where are they found?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Axolotls are found in Lake Xochimilco, found in the Valley of Mexico by Mexico City. They are a critically endangered species due to their habitat being degraded, and they also used to be consumed as a street food.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Axolotls also used to be found in Lake Chalco, but that lake was drained as a flood-preventative measure. This leaves Xochimilco as the last axolotl stronghold.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 2013, a field study attempted to measure how many individuals remained in the lake. The study found none. However, a couple months later, two wild individuals were spotted in the canals leading to Xomochimilco, so the city has begun building axolotl shelters.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Axolotls still face challenges in the wild if they do remain: invasive species eat their young, and they are competing with new predators for their prey.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pictures to the left: The Floating Gardens of Xomochimilco are well known exhibits in this city borough. They are found in the canals along Lake Xomochimilco.</p>

        <h1>What about in capitivity?</h1>
        <hr>
          <p>Axolotls thrive in the pet trade and in lab settings due to their high desirability. They're studied extensively due to their ability to regenerate limbs.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Axolotls' regeneration is legendary: they do so without any scarring, can take transplants from other axolotls (including eyes and parts of the brain), and have been known to regenerate less critical parts of their brain. They also regrow lost limbs and heal damaged ones. This makes them key in cancer studies.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <h2>Where could I get one?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>They can be obtained from reputable breeders and kept safely by enthusiasts, but beware! Tank setup and care is not a simple thing. Do not buy an axolotl if you do not intend to care for them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>That regeneration skill comes in handy when raising young axolotls - they're cannibalistic as young salamanders and will eat anything they can fit in their mouth, including one another and each other's limbs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>They find food by smell, so they may mistake one another during feeding times especially. Once they reach adulthood, they are typically no longer cannibalistic.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <h3>How long do they live?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Axolotls can live up to 15 years! They are a commitment and will require a lot of attention.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Always be prepared to put in at least $300 before considering buying an axolotl.</p>

        <h1>What do they need in captivity?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Ideally, a single axolotl should have 20 gallons of water. They are <strong>cold water amphibians</strong> and therefore you will need either a cold room to keep them in or a chiller for the tank.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Adult axolotls can cohabitate! You should aim for a base of 20 gallons + 10 more for however many tankmates your axolotl has. So if you have two axolotls, you should have a 30 gallon tank, and if you have three, you should have a 40 gallon tank.</p>

        <h1>What do they eat?</h1>
        <hr>
          <p>Axolotls are obligate carnivores that feed on bugs, worms, and small fish.</p>
          <br>
          <p>They have vestigial teeth that they don't use - instead, they use suction of bringing water into their mouths to drag prey in and swallow.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This feeding mechanism is why you shouldn't house axolotls on gravel that they can swallow -- always put them on either fine sand or rocks too big to swallow.</p>
          <br>
          <p>That way they won't fill up on gravel and potentially damage their internal organs.</p>
