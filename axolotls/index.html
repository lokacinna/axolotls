  <h1>All About Axolotls</h1>

    <h3>What is an axolotl?</h3>
    <p>Axolotls are a type of amphibian in the salamander family.</p>
</div>

<div class="panel twop">
  <h1>Where do they live?</h1>
  <hr>
    <p>In the wild, axolotls are only found in Lake Xochimilco, which is located in the Valley of Mexico. They're critically endangered and have only a few individuals left spotted in the lake.</p>
</div>

<div class="panel onep">
  <h1>What about in capitivity?</h1>
  <hr>
    <p>Axolotls thrive in the pet trade and in lab settings due to their high desirability. They're studied extensively due to their ability to regenerate limbs.</p>
</div>

<div class="panel twop">
  <h1>Where do they live?</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Ideally, a single axolotl should have 20 gallons of water. They are <strong>cold water amphibians</strong> and therefore you will need either a cold room to keep them in or a chiller for the tank.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Adult axolotls can cohabitate! You should aim for a base of 20 gallons + however many tankmates your axolotl has. So if you have two axolotls, you should have a 30 gallon tank, and if you have three, you should have a 40 gallon tank.</p>
